# D&D 4e Character Template for use with DiceLink

# Add dicelink@appspot.com to your Wave to use this Character Sheet.
# Search for Tag:DiceLink to find more info about DiceLink.
# I hardly claim this as my own work. I'm simply exploiting the work done by Klaus (most everything in this was stolen from him).
# Please feel free to edit it as needed for spelling/syntax (Please make major changes in your own wave/blip or make a suggestion).

# Basic Concept:
# The Character Sheet has been split into two parts, since the implementation of Templates: the Template and the Character Sheet.
# The Template holds all the data that are common to all characters. It is mostly the formulas/backend.
# The Character Sheet holds all the data that are specific to an individual character.
# Changes made to the Template are, more or less, made for all the characters.
# If the same data exists in both the Template and Character Sheet, the Character Sheet data is used.

# Basic Usage:
# This is the Default template that you'll copy into your Wave.
# You only need one copy of a template per Wave.
# Any Character Sheets that reference this template will refer to it for any queries that aren't explicitly defined in the Character Sheet.

Cast AtWill Power B: d20 + WisP  "vs Reflex"
At-Will Power B Hit: d6 + WisMod "radiant damage (Effect: One ally you can see may choose to gain {ChaMod} temporary hit points)"

Cast Encounter Power A: d20 + WisP  "vs Will"
Encounter Power A Hit: d10 + WisMod "radiant damage, and you push the target {3+ChaMod} squares away from you. The target is immobilized until the end of your next turn."
Encounter Power A Miss: div(d10 + WisMod, 2) "radiant damage and the target is not pushed or immobilized."

Encounter Power B: WisMod + d6 "plus the target's Surge Value"

Cast Encounter Power C: d20 + WisP "vs Will"
Encounter Power C Hit: "The target moves its Speed + {ChaMod} away from you. This movement provokes opportunity attacks."

# Helpful tip for Powers with long names... You may want to create some power shortcuts for easier faster rolling if you find you are getting tired of always typing out "[Cast AtWill Power A]". These are very easy to do...

Cast A: Cast AtWill Power A "AtWill Power A"
# Now you can just use "[Cast A]" and it gives the exact same roll and tags on a comment about what power you used for the DM and other players.
